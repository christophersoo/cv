            <h1>Need Your <strong>Data Analysed?</strong></h1>
            <p>With a strong foundation in descriptive and inferential statistics,
                as well as being a proficient Python and R programmer, I am
                confident in my ability to pre-process raw data and deliver valuable insights for data-driven decisions
                <br><br>
                As a University Student currently enrolled in a data science course in Bristol University,
                I strive for challenges which will allow me to learn more.
                <br><br>
                Not only am I passionate in the fields of IT,
                I am also eager to learn various fields such as the BFSI Industry, the Health Industry, and so on...

            <h1>What is <strong>Data Science?</strong></h1>
            <p>
                Data science combines math and statistics,
                specialized programming, advanced analytics,
                artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning
                with specific subject-matter expertise to uncover
                actionable insights hidden in an organizationâ€™s data.
                These insights can be used to guide decision-making
                and strategic planning (IBM, nd).<br><br>
